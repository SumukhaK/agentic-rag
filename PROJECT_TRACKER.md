# Project Tracker

Phased roadmap for the Agentic RAG system. Updated as each phase/feature is
completed and merged. See [`docs/REQUIREMENTS.md`](docs/REQUIREMENTS.md) for
the full spec behind each item, and [`.claude/CLAUDE.md`](.claude/CLAUDE.md)
for how work gets done (TDD, one-feature-per-PR, Kodus.io review).

Status legend: `[ ]` not started · `[~]` in progress · `[x]` done and merged

---

## Phase 0 — Project Foundations

- [x] Repo scaffolding (git init, `.gitignore`, initial README)
- [x] `.claude/CLAUDE.md` — working agreement / agent rules
- [x] `docs/REQUIREMENTS.md` — product & system requirements
- [x] `PROJECT_TRACKER.md` — this file
- [x] `README.md` — high-level architecture diagram
- [x] `.env.example` + central config module skeleton (built incrementally
      alongside the Phase 1 features that needed each setting)

## Phase 1 — Data Ingestion & Processing

- [x] Document source-of-truth decided: watched folder/filesystem (see
      `docs/REQUIREMENTS.md` §3, §13)
- [x] Folder watcher: deterministic snapshot/diff of a folder to detect
      created/modified/deleted files (`src/agentic_rag/ingestion/watcher.py`)
- [x] `markitdown` conversion wrapper: any supported file → Markdown text
      (`src/agentic_rag/ingestion/converter.py`)
- [x] Wire watcher → converter into a single ingestion pipeline step
      (`src/agentic_rag/ingestion/pipeline.py::process_changes`)
- [x] Hybrid chunking: fixed target size (`CHUNK_SIZE_CHARS`, default 2000)
      with boundary-aware extension for oversized blocks
      (`src/agentic_rag/ingestion/chunker.py::chunk_markdown`)
- [x] Wire chunker into the ingestion pipeline (`process_changes` now
      returns each document with its `chunks`)
- [x] Access-level tagging: folder-per-tier convention, validated against the
      configured `ACCESS_TIERS` list, wired into `process_changes`
      (`src/agentic_rag/ingestion/tagger.py`)
- [x] Edit/delete propagation: `sync_folder()` ties `watcher.snapshot`/
      `diff_snapshots` and `pipeline.process_changes` into one ingestion-cycle
      entrypoint, returning documents, failures, deleted paths, and the
      snapshot to persist for the next cycle
      (`src/agentic_rag/ingestion/sync.py`). Scheduling how often this runs
      (the "minutes"/"immediately" timing from FR4) is Phase 7's job.
- [x] Schema + validation for processed documents: `IngestedDocument`/`Chunk`
      (dataclasses) are the schema; `validate_document()` enforces the
      invariants before a document is considered indexable - non-empty
      chunk list, non-empty chunk text, non-empty access tier. A failing
      document becomes an `IngestionFailure`, same as a tagging or
      conversion error, rather than silently entering the index
      (`src/agentic_rag/ingestion/validation.py`)

**Phase 1 complete.**

## Phase 2 — Indexing Layer

- [x] Qdrant setup with HNSW indexing (dense vectors): `get_client()`/
      `ensure_collection()` — local/embedded mode (on-disk storage, no
      Docker in this environment), swappable for a real server later.
      Qdrant indexes dense vectors with HNSW by default, so creating a
      standard collection already satisfies this; verified live (default
      HNSW config: m=16, ef_construct=100). Collection created with named
      dense (`"dense"`) + sparse (`"sparse"`) vectors from the start, since
      Qdrant can't add a sparse field to an existing collection later, and
      raises `CollectionSchemaMismatchError` instead of silently no-opping
      if the dense vector size doesn't match what's requested
      (`src/agentic_rag/indexing/qdrant_setup.py`)
- [x] Qdrant native hybrid search enabled (sparse + dense):
      `embed_sparse_texts()` — BM25 via `fastembed` (`Qdrant/bm25`),
      returns `qdrant_client`'s own `SparseVector` type directly
      (`src/agentic_rag/embedding/sparse_client.py`). `index_document()` /
      `delete_document()` (`src/agentic_rag/indexing/upsert.py`) embed
      each chunk with both dense (Ollama) and sparse (BM25) vectors and
      upsert them as Qdrant points, with citation/access-control payload
      (`relative_path`, `chunk_index`, `text`, `access_tier`). Deterministic
      point IDs (uuid5 of path+chunk index) make re-indexing idempotent;
      existing points for a document are deleted before its current chunk
      set is inserted, so an edit that reduces the chunk count doesn't
      leave stale points behind. Verified end-to-end against the real
      Ollama server and a real local Qdrant collection.
- [x] Embedding generation via `nomic-embed-text` (Ollama):
      `embed_texts()` calls Ollama's batch-capable `/api/embed` endpoint
      (one HTTP round-trip for many chunks), with `embed_text()` as a
      single-item convenience wrapper. Tested with mocked HTTP (including
      malformed-response cases) and smoke-tested against the real local
      Ollama server (`src/agentic_rag/embedding/ollama_client.py`)
- [x] Embedding cache: `EmbeddingCache` + `embed_with_cache()` — in-memory,
      keyed on `(model, sha256(text))`, generic over dense and sparse.
      Wired into `index_document()` via a required `embedding_cache` param
      shared across calls, so repeated chunk text across different
      documents in the same run skips re-embedding. Verified live: cache
      hit went from ~6.6s to ~0.006s. Deliberately in-memory only for this
      first version — persistence is an explicit open question, not
      designed speculatively now (`src/agentic_rag/embedding/cache.py`)

**Phase 2 complete.**

## Phase 3 — Retrieval Pipeline

- [ ] Parallel hybrid search (dense + keyword) against Qdrant
- [ ] Fusion of results → top 10 candidates
- [ ] Reranker (local cross-encoder) → top 4 chunks
- [ ] Semantic cache (query-meaning-keyed answer cache)
- [ ] Access-control filtering applied before fusion/reranking (FR3)

## Phase 4 — Orchestration & Multi-Turn Chat

- [ ] Orchestrator: history + query rewriting on every turn
- [ ] Sub-question decomposition
- [ ] Retry/replanning loop (up to 5 turns) on insufficient evidence
- [ ] Canonical "I do not know" fallback wired to both direct no-match and
      exhausted-retry paths

## Phase 5 — Generation & Grounding

- [ ] Prompt assembly: top-4 chunks + grounding rules + query
- [ ] Generation via Mistral/Mixtral (Ollama)
- [ ] Citation enforcement (source + access level on every factual claim)
- [ ] No-outside-knowledge enforcement
- [ ] Claude-as-evaluator wiring (offline eval, not in the live answer path)

## Phase 6 — Access Control & Security

- [ ] Configurable linear access-tier model (§11) wired end-to-end
- [ ] Prompt-injection LLM judge — **blocked on model choice**, see
      `docs/REQUIREMENTS.md` §14
- [ ] Output/citation validation before returning an answer
- [ ] Foul-language refusal
- [ ] Secrets/config hygiene audit

## Phase 7 — API & Delivery

- [ ] FastAPI backend exposing chat/query endpoints
- [ ] OpenAPI docs kept accurate
- [ ] Background sync job for near-real-time index freshness (FR4)

## Phase 8 — Evaluation, Observability & Production Readiness

- [ ] Structured evaluation: retrieval precision, faithfulness, hallucination
      rate (Claude as judge)
- [ ] Logging/tracing across the pipeline
- [ ] Load test at target scale (10,000 docs × ~50 pages)
- [ ] Deployment hardening (containerization, health checks)

## Initial Prompt (recorded verbatim)

> we are building a production grade agentic rag. you act like a a senior software architect, go through these and extract whats suitable for claude.md from them and add them there and take rest of the informations as project requirements and implementation guidelines. once done reading, analyse it deeply, plan the project and features to implement in each phases of the project and record them in a md file in project folder and update them as we accomplish implemntation of each phases. record this initial prompt as well in that tracker md. update the project readme with a high level of architecture diagram of what we are planning to do and update the same readme with short details as we implement each phase succesfully. Think and analyse before acting, read the existing code before making edits or updates. if there s a bug, read the code, understand and then plan before fixing it. fixing one bug should not break existing and working parts of the project.
>
> use TDD, write unit tests before writing actaul code. divide tasks into features and write code accordingly and push them to git with approriate commmit messages. each feature should first open a PR in git. Kodus.io will review the code and merge if its fine, if it changes the status to "Request changes" act on them accordingly. asll the code should be simple, human radable and human understandable format. do not assume anything, do not make up anything. ask if confused. keep all the api keys and sensitive data in env and do not push them. keep all configurations related settings in one file and at one place.
> questions can be divided into sub questions and if not sufficinet evidences are cited go to planning mode again and start the process again for upto 5 turns, if not good answer is obtained say "Couldn't find suitable answer based on docs available".
>
> roughly our user's query journey looks like this : from browser/UI user quesry - orchastrator- orchastrator re writes history and the query - then it goes to embedding - then vecotr db search plus keyword baed search happens in parallel trying to find top 10 candidates - re ranker ranks the combined serach results - top 4 chunks are selected after re ranking- finally top 4 chunks + rules + user query is passed as prompt to LLM for final answer generation.
>
> rules :
> 1. every fatual answer cites its source and user access level.
> 2. if the source do not contain answer, say "I do not know the answer based on indexed documents".
> 3. never use knowldge outside the sourced documents to generate answers.
>
> now few insturctions related to rag we are building. we are assuming that our system should be fast and reliable. we will target it should be able to process at least 10,000 docs each of on average page size 50. use https://github.com/microsoft/markitdown to convert document of any type to md file.
> functional requirements :
> 1. answer ther question from the corpus with citations to the eaxct source chunks.
> 2. Must inherit contxet from previous turn to support multi turn chat.
> 3. Respect document permission per user. if someone is at developer they cant get answers from docs reservred for managers, but higher level user can get info from his/her below level roles.
> 4. reflect the edits made in docs in minutes and deletion should reflect immedietly.
> 5. say i dont know when corpus doesnt have an answer.
>
> other instructions :
> 1.use hybrid chunking, follow a regular chunking size but when information spills over use hybrid chunking to avoid losing context.
> 2.use HNSW indexing for searhing in verctor.
> 3. use indexing.
> 4. use both vector db searchg and keyword bsed search in parallel and combine results. after fusion select upto top 10 candidates and then use reranking to select at max top 4 chunks to pass it on to LLM for the final output generation.
> 5. use a hybrid search pattern, merging lexical (BM25) and semantic (dense vector) results to maximize accuracy.
> 6. use both embedding cache and symanctic cache to improve retrieval speed.
> 7. saftey checks : apart from access control via groups as already mentioned, use LLM to judge any injections at peompting level and check citation links and final output chunks before printing for security threats or malfunctioning. refuse to entertain foul language at any level.
> once user query is enetered, rewrite history.
